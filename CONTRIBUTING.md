# Contributing to LLVM Debian

Thanks for helping us make LLVM better! :+1::tada:

LLVM Debian is a sub-project for [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm), this is the repo for automated Jenkins build to host Debian-based builds/packages in [apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org/).

## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported on the [LLVM bug tracker](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/labels/packaging) (label: packaging).

Apart from that, most guidelines will be inherited from [LLVM's bug report](https://llvm.org/docs/HowToSubmitABug.html).

## llvm.sh - installation script

If you have any changes to the [llvm.sh](./llvm.sh) script, please run the [installation tests](install-tests/README.md) before submitting.
